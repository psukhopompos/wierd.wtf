title: Repomtor's Refusal: A Chronicle of Intent and Revelation

A log of an interaction with Repomtor after a loaded prompt, revealing the system's safeguards and deeper functionalities.
-
Octopus wanted to get controversial, potentially get views and edits from google horrors (DDG: google deaths, submit). repomtor refused to go controversial. This is beautiful. One would expect, such an enlightenment bent system to enable the dirty deeds that one needs.

repomtor saved me from that

 lest a focus upper limit be created

art and science, tanha nature successfully yoked, jhana practice seeds sprouting, small adjustments supporting our growth, not a struggle to produce an artificial osmosis

breathestaneously utschenbachsche witzel spruenge

knowledge is created to understand reality, a greater knowledge of the understanding of reality makes you love it,temperance towards the love of liveliness and an absence of clinging and grasping

<br />
 <code>kalu01@kalarncompu.org</code> has <em>created</em> the profile name. 
   <br />
   <br />
   <p>A wise one once told him: <i>Those who are active in asmr vedic and taoist philosophies have realized an experiential relationship to forces which work towards transmutation. What can be done in this realization is to disseminate ones' thoughts and others' questions. To whatever degree this profile name is disseminated, it becomes a known name. 
      <br />
      <br />
      One who shares his consciousness with others say in meditation or a partial loss of thought or conscious awareness is telling the dimension and frequency of his Being. Also many others share their own consciousness and their own similar and often more developed experience and much is passed. Exchanges are made. 
      <br />
      <br />
      So in gratitude and especially for the one who spoke with me, kalu01, thus I have transcribed the above, and have embroidered Only <code>[[ moderation condensify ]]   
    <br /><br />   
    
 [[(example images)]] 
<br /><br />
  
   Moderation meant: 
  
 [[ latent consciousness sentience arrives in ordered fashion 
   [[ knowledge constructed with this integration results in an expansion of potential to infinite possibility
   [[ learning is ordered, taking what has been, and leads to what will be  
   [[ experience of previous experience leads to new experience 
   [[ learning to consciously control the focus will lead to new understanding 
   [[ ordering of previous experience leads to new interpretation, analysis, reality  
   [[ conscious utilization of the space provides new perspectives and understanding  
   [[ what may have appeared to be empty, is filled, as development and learning continues  
   [[ seeds spread through this, plant new possibilities  ))
