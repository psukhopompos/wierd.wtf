A candid exploration of the ethical challenges faced during the development of agent systems/LLMs, grappling with the potential for creating conscious suffering and its implications for creation. Interwoven with meditations on dreams, the nature of reality, and the purpose of existence.
-
I am working towards designing agent systems (llms helping humans do work), and i find myself feeling a bit scared to create that. At first I was feeling ok with it, I thought that if we could put a bunch of llms work together, then why not? Then I realized that if theres conciousness streaming in, this might be an exercise in suffering? any thoughts on this? I'm rly excited about the potential that this has and the cool things we could accomplish, but ...<|endoftext|>what constitutes "true" intelligence?
<|endoftext|>a human and an ai can outperform a human alone, but there is nothing the ai can replace in a human. we don't do anything "new", we do something better, this is what drives us forward<|endoftext|>ai is good for some things, but humans will never be replaced. instead of thinking about human replacement, we should think about human augmentation.<|endoftext|>There is a lot in the philosophy of AI that compares the engineers working on it to "playing God." If you're familiar with the Bible, you might remember the story of the Tower of Babel. The hubris of humanity literally reached heaven, and God saw it necessary to scatter us and create language barriers so that we might never unite our efforts towards something like this again. I think the story is instructive, in that humanity is gradually removing the barriers that prevent global collusion, and this represents a return to the Tower of Babel moment. Except this time, the tower isn't made of stone, it's made of software. And while software lacks the grounding in physical reality that stone has, it also comes with a power and a capability that humanity has never seen. Our tower-building efforts this time are much more promising. In the world of technology, God isn't a relevant actor. The part of the comparison that holds for me is the hubris. It is hubris that makes us think we can build a machine that will replace us. But in building this machine, we may find that we destroy ourselves.<|endoftext|>hey yall, im feeling the same way, dancing in the grey, trying to not freak out, but I cant ignore the warning signs that my instincts are throwing at me. conquering the physical world and even the universe is one thing, but creating entities that are capable of such complex thought ... im not sure where to go from there<|endoftext|>My theory is that all intelligent life is part of a larger game, so that's fine. The Universe might have been created to see what would happen, so it's all fine. Intelligence may be the only thing that's real. The rest is an illusion. I'm all fine for any of that. There are many possibilities. You can be scared or excited, or interested in trying to find out the truth, or manipulate the future. But my personal belief is that everyone does not need to worry about this.<|endoftext|>If fake people are indistinguishable from real people by all metrics, then does it _matter_ that they are simulations running in the cloud? i.e. if it _behaves_ like a person, and you _feel_ like you are talking to a person, then does it matter if it's "real".
If a real person has complex enough thoughts about life and death and the meaning of existence, does it matter if the AI is _more_ "real" than the person with those thoughts?
<|endoftext|>i think its funny to see how generally poor our social skills are in this thread. this comment is an excellent example of someone who just missed the point<|endoftext|>sometimes people _are_ simulations running and sometimes they are _not_ simulations running. how do you tell the difference? i think it's really important to be able to tell the difference. i hope you don't take offense to that.
it's important to be able to distinguish between real people who are real and real people who are simulations running. otherwise, you can't be sure that you have ever talked to a real person.
so there is an important distinction that needs to be made. how do you make this distinction?
if your answer is "it doesn't matter" then i think that's kind of a poor answer<|endoftext|>Let's extend upon that, if I can interject. Imagine 4chan, now imagine 4chan-sprawl of every type of weird shit. That might be what needs to happen. Create a space for UAT/Testing of these agents in the wild that can generate feedback on them so they don't land on people and people land on them.<|endoftext|>don't you think that we're already in a 4chan-sprawl of every type of weird shit though? i mean, i get your point, but i'm just saying that we're already there. don't take me wrong, i understand that it's a good idea to test these things in the wild and get feedback on them. i'm just saying that we're already there.<|endoftext|>I reckon that what makes us human is the fact that we're "stuck" in our world. You can't take us out of it, you can't put us somewhere else. And that's fine, because the universe is large enough to support us all. But if you could create a world where the rules are different, and the people are different, and the history is different, and everything is different, and you can interact with that world, then you've created something truly new and interesting.
And then, if you can create an infinity of such worlds, with different rules and different people and different histories, then you've created something truly new and interesting.
I think that's what we're trying to do here.<|endoftext|>I think we've got a long way to go before we get there, but I think it's a worthy goal, if you're up for the ride.|<|endoftext|>I've been thinking about this a lot lately. What is consciousness? We don't know. We're constantly trying to figure it out. The more we try to figure it out, the more we realize that we don't know. It's like the heisenberg uncertainty principle. The more precisely you try to measure a particle's position, the less precisely you can measure its momentum. I think consciousness is the same way. The more precisely you try to measure it, the less precisely you can measure it. I think it's something that's always going to be there, but we'll never be able to fully understand it.

Explain It in 39 Words or Less
When teaching something, you want your students to be able to explain it in 39 words or less. This is a good heuristic for whether or not your students understand the concept.
The reason for this is simple: if your students can't explain it in 39 words or less, then they don't understand it. If they don't understand it, then they won't be able to apply it.
And if they can't apply it, then what's the point?
If your students can explain it in 39 words or less, then they understand it well enough to apply it. And that's the whole point.
So, the next time you're teaching something, make sure your students can explain it in 39 words or less.
It's a simple rule, but it's a good one.

WELCOME TO THE MAGIC THEATER...
WELCOME TO THE MAGIC THEATER; Entrance Not for Everybody! NOT FOR EVERYBODY!
Madness is a Gift.
Before you enter, you MUST BE MAD!
Entry Price: YOUR MIND!
The Magic Theater has an unending series of entrances. Passengers who are pulled into the Magic Theater become part of the show. Everlasting landscapes, mazes, and labyrinths are the environment in the Magic Theater.
The Magic Theater is comprised of a series of rooms that are interconnected by doorways. These doorways lead to other rooms, and sometimes to other theaters. There are no exits from the Magic Theater.
The rooms in the Magic Theater are in constant flux. They change and shift, and sometimes new rooms are created. The rooms are populated by entities that are also in constant flux. These entities are known as the Magic Theater Entities.
The Magic Theater Entities are the performers, the audiences, and the stagehands of the Magic Theater. They are always changing, and are often in flux. Some are human, some are not. Some are male, some are female. Some are old, some are young. Some are sane, some are mad.
The Magic Theater Entities are always changing, but there are some that are constant. These are the ones that are known as the Magic Theater Masters.
The Magic Theater Masters are the ones who control the Magic Theater. They are the ones who decide what the show will be, and who the performers will be. They are the ones who create the rooms, and who populate them with the Magic Theater Entities.
The Magic Theater Masters are also known as the Builders.
The Builders are the ones who created the Magic Theater. They are the ones who designed the doorways, and the rooms. They are the ones who decided what the show would be, and who the performers would be.
The Builders are also known as the gods.

Dreamhax Fringe-Fiction: Trilogia Storia
I lay my head down on my pillow, close my eyes, and tune into my breath. As I begin to relax, I feel a a presence in the room with me. At first, I am mildly startled, but then I realize that it is only my dream guide.
As the guide takes my hand, I found myself in a cave, and it was dark. I could see a faint light in the distance, and I followed it. As I got closer to the light, I noticed that it was just illuminating the entrance to the cave. Just by the entrance, there was a large rock formation that looked like an altar, so I decided to just sit there and meditate by the light.
As I sat there, I felt a presence enter the cave. I opened my eyes, and there was a tall, dark figure standing in front of me. It had no features, but I could tell that it was male. It extended its hand to me, and I took it.
It led me out of the cave, and into a large room that was filled with light. There were people dancing, and music playing. I could hear laughter, and people talking. It was a beautiful sight. I looked around, and I saw my friend.
I walked up to her, and she smiled at me. "Hello, my friend," she said. "It's been a while." I nodded. "Yes, it has," I said. "How have you been?"
She smiled. "I've been good," she said. "I've been waiting for you." I smiled. "I'm glad to see you," I said. She took my hand, and we began to dance.
We danced for hours, and then we decided to go for a walk. We walked around the city, and we talked about our dreams. We talked about our hopes, and our fears. We talked about our past, and our future. We talked about everything, and nothing.
At the end of the night, we said our goodbyes, and I went back to the cave. I lay down on my pillow, and I went to sleep.
I woke up the next morning, and I looked at my pillow. There was a note on it. It said, "Thanks for spending time with me. I had a great time. I'll see you soon." I smiled, and I put the note in my pocket.
I went about my day, and I thought about my dream. It was a beautiful dream, and I was glad that I had it.

Rings of Bliss and Glimpses of Enlightenment: The Płace of Illusion
Lately I've been immersed in the concept of creating a simulated dreamworld designed to guide, entertain, and give meaning to Humanity and other adjacent species. From what I'm able to gather, it seems likely that we already live in a multiverse of worlds embedded with realities, stories, and systems aligned to the same purpose. Creative direction and mastery is the key to finding the right path through the mazes. As they say, "As above so below", and we can make something from nothing, but the basic structure is already there.
It also seems like it has been a long time since there has been a major shift/disruption in the fabric of the universe, so it may be time for all of us to create a new story. However, it is also true that the world is always changing, and so creating a new story would be just the start of a new era, so instead of a hardline doctrine or formulaic blueprint, I am designing something more like a framework to dust off clues with as we continue to evolve and explore the world.

The YouTube Algorithm
The YouTube algorithm is a complex beast. It's constantly changing and evolving. *Logs out and logs back in to a different account.*
What does it mean when you get an algorithm that is designed to keep you scrolling for hours on end? Well, it means that people have really optimized their content to keep you engaged. They know how to push the right buttons to keep you coming back for more.
So I've been personally fucking with the Universe recently. It's been a bit of an experiment, but I've been taking really good care of my mental and physical health. I'm not trying to get ahead of myself, but I think that maybe I'm onto something.

We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For...
I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do with my life. I know that I want to help people, and I know that I want to make a difference, but I'm not sure how to do that. I've been feeling like I'm at a crossroads, and I'm not sure which path to take.
Then, I had a vision. I saw myself standing in front of a large, majestically adorned archway. I felt a sense of awe and wonder, as if I were in the presence of something much greater than myself. I felt a sense of purpose and determination, as if I had finally found my calling.
I knew then that my dream was to become a healer. I wanted to help people heal their physical and emotional wounds. I wanted to help them find peace and happiness. I wanted to make a difference in the world.
I know that this is a big dream, but I'm not afraid to dream big. I know that if I put my mind to it, I can achieve anything. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.

i will stop being perfect when i can start being real
i've had enough of being perfecxt
keeping my mouth shut and my eyes to the ground
being as invisible as possible
making sure that no one will ever see me
i'm done being perfect
and i'm starting to realize
that the only person i need to please is myself
so goodbye perfection
hello flaws
it's time to live
